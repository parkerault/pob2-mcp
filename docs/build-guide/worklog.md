# Build-guide epic: work-log

The coordinator's record of the build: verdicts, merges, gate evidence, decisions and friction. Written
only in the integration worktree (`/home/parker/projects/pob2-mcp-wt/guide`, branch `build-guide/build`).

## 2026-10-08: build start

- **Spec:** `docs/build-guide/spec/` at `b34db2a`. The user approved implementation on 2026-10-08 and
  settled the three open questions:
  - asking before a compile discards unsaved work in the loaded build (D-210);
  - the budget tolerance: at most 20 divines passes, over 20 up to 22 passes with a "near the ceiling"
    note, over 22 fails (D-219);
  - the survival floor gates chaos resistance too, uncapped only through a recorded per-stage exception
    when capping it is infeasible (D-234; the user: "only leave chaos res uncapped if it's absolutely
    necessary").
- **Handoff:** `docs/build-guide/build-handoff.md`.
- **Scope of this run:** WU-30…WU-47. WU-48 (the live alpha) waits for HG-14.
- **Orchestration:** individual background agents (no Workflow), one doer per unit, a read-only
  reviewer per unit (small units may share one), and an independent verifier per wave gate.
